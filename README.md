## Welcome to my Github Profile
I love solving challenging problems, exploring Linux and open source projects and writing tutorials for the things I try for my 3 am dose of serotonin.

## Tech Stack:
- For my day job, I work with the likes of NodeJS, ExpressJS, Apollo GraphQl, Neo4j, SQL, Redis and AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, ElastiCache, CodePipeline, Lambda).
- I usually solve leetcode problems and write automation scripts in Python.
- My portfolio is written in Next.js.
- I am currently learning [Rust](https://github.com/k-amin07/Rust) as a hobby.
- I have previously worked with Stem library for Tor and Selenium for automation in Python.

## My Gists:
